In the dynamic sport of synchronized skating, Kyan’s path stands out as a testament to dedication and passion. From her early days on the ice, to becoming a member of the Haydenettes, Kyan's story is one driven by continuous growth and the power of inspiration.

### Early Years

Kyan's journey on the ice began almost as soon as she could walk. Reflecting on her start, she says, 
> "I started skating when I was just one year old because my mom is a skating coach." 

By the age of four, Kyan explored synchronized skating, joining Saint Louis Synergy Synchronized Skating Teams. Her formative years were marked by steady progression through the Formation to Juvenile teams. When she was 12, she took a break from synchronized skating to pursue singles skating at a higher level. After a few injuries, she decided to return to Saint Louis Synergy and to try out for, and ultimately skate for their Junior Team. These experiences paved the way for her to dream bigger and set her sights on trying out for the Hayden Synchro.

### Inspiration and Determination

Kyan’s ambition to join the Haydenettes was sparked by watching Laura, co-founder of ELEVATE Synchro and a skater she deeply admired, perform with the team. She recalls,
> "Watching Laura skate with the Haydenettes was what inspired me to try out for Hayden Synchro." 

The COVID-19 pandemic created uncertainty, but a pivotal moment came in 2021 when she witnessed a performance in California. By her junior year of college, Kyan was set in her decision to pursue this goal, driven by her dream to compete at the highest levels of synchronized skating. “Seeing them skate in California in 2021 made me realize that this is what I want to do. It made me realize that I really wanted to skate in college and–hopefully–on the Haydenettes,” she says.

### Overcoming Transition Challenges

Transitioning to the senior-level came with significant challenges. 
> "Adapting to their style was tough. The power, the free legs, and all the tiny details—they expect you to pick it up quickly," 

The team’s demand for precision and the execution of intricate moves required her to push her physical limits. She had to quickly adapt to the new style, mastering complex elements like death spirals and lifts, all while building strength off the ice as well. Moving away from home and balancing college life added to the complexity. However, Kyan's mental preparation and the support from mentors helped her navigate these hurdles successfully. 
> “Having someone like Laura to guide me through the transition was super nice. She told me about her experience and what it was like being a first year on the team, so I had some sort of idea of what it could be like for me."

### Growth and Achievements

Since joining the Haydenettes, Kyan has experienced profound growth both as a skater and as a person. 
> “My skating skills have improved so much. But more than that, I’ve made friends who are like family to me,” 

Her time with the team has been transformative, enhancing her abilities and strengthening her mental and physical resilience. Among her proudest achievements are competing at high levels and mastering challenging moves like death spirals. 
> “Learning how to go down in a death spiral was a huge win for me. It took me such a long time to figure it out and I was so proud of myself when I finally did.” 

### The Impact of ELEVATE Camps

ELEVATE Synchronized Skating Camps have been instrumental in Kyan’s development as a skater. 
> “The camps were a game-changer for me. There was one session on mental strength and goal setting that really prepared me for the senior level,” 

The camps offered sessions on mental strength training and goal setting, crucial in preparing her for the challenges of senior-level competition. Being exposed to a variety of coaching styles from instructors across the country allowed her to refine her technique and discover what worked best for her. Additionally, the camps provided her with the opportunity to learn not just for personal improvement but also to coach and inspire others. 
> “Seeing different coaching styles helped me figure out my own style and how I can teach others effectively.” 

### Memorable Camp Experiences

Among the many impactful experiences at the ELEVATE camps, Kyan recalls, 
> “One of the most memorable moments was a goal-setting activity. It pushed me to think about outlining my long-term goals so that I can figure out how to achieve them.” 

Participating in synchro camps also helped her build connections with fellow skaters, some of whom have become her teammates on the Haydenettes.

### Advice to Aspiring Skaters

To young skaters aspiring to reach the senior level, Kyan offers encouraging words: 
> “Follow your dreams. Everything is attainable if you work hard for it. Stay focused, but don’t forget to have fun.” 

She emphasizes the importance of attending camps like ELEVATE, where skaters can meet peers, become part of a supportive community, and potentially form bonds with future teammates. 
> “Going to camps like ELEVATE can make such a difference. You meet people who share your passion, and some of them could be your future teammates.” 

### Looking Ahead

As Kyan prepares for the upcoming season with the Haydenettes, her goals are clear. 
> “I want to keep improving and find my place within the team. I want to help the first-year members just like others helped me,” 

Kyan aims to continue honing her skills, establish her role on the team, and take on the responsibility of mentoring new members. She is determined to contribute to the team’s success while ensuring that they have a fun and fulfilling season. 
> “This year, I’m looking forward to having fun and making new memories with the team. We had such a great time last year, and I hope we can build on that.” 

In 2024, Kyan took on a new role as a counselor at the ELEVATE Synchro Camp in Pleasant Prairie, WI. Here, she had the opportunity to inspire and guide young skaters, sharing the knowledge and experiences that have shaped her journey. Her story is a example of dedication and resilience, serving as an inspiration to aspiring skaters and a reminder of the joy found in pursuing one's passion.
