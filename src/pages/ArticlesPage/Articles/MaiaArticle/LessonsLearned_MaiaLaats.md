We had the privilege of talking to World Silver Medalist Maia Laats, who spent five transformative years skating with the Haydenettes from 2019 to 2024. During this formative period, she gathered experiences and insights that shaped not only her skating career but also her approach to life. In a conversation with one of our founders, Maia shares the most significant lessons she learned during her time with the Haydenettes.


### 1.	Trust Your Coach

Maia begins by emphasizing the importance of trusting one's coach, even when it's challenging. Reflecting on her experiences, she notes:

> "However annoying it is, your coach always knows best."

This simple yet profound lesson goes a long way, especially in synchronized skating. In a sport where a bird’s-eye view is necessary, coaches see potential and pitfalls in programs that athletes might not, steering them towards excellence even when their path seems difficult.

### 2. Balance Skating with Other Passions

For many athletes, the sport can become all-consuming. Maia underscores the importance of diversifying one's interests to maintain a healthy balance:

> "Skating should never be everything in your life. Find things outside of the skating world that make you happy."

By cultivating passions beyond skating, skaters can bring a more rounded perspective to their training and performances, ultimately enhancing their overall well-being so that they can bring their best selves to practice!

### 3. Build Connections Beyond Skating

Maia learned the value of forming deep connections with her teammates that extend beyond their shared sport:

> "It is important to build ties with your teammates that are not ALL based around skating. Talk about something other than skating, do a different activity, find something that connects you outside of the sport, because it will only strengthen the bond you already have."

These bonds, she believes, create a supportive network that enriches both personal and professional lives, fostering a sense of camaraderie and trust that is absolutely vital for team success.

### 4. Foster a Sense of Belonging

Creating an inclusive environment where every team member feels valued is a lesson Maia cherishes:

> "It's important that every single team member feels like they belong. The smallest actions can have huge impacts on the experiences of younger teammates. By my fifth year on the team, all I wanted to hear was that the first years felt happy coming to practice. That it was a safe space for them to learn and grow, and that they felt valued and seen. Hand squeezes, small compliments, mini jokes during a practice—even just asking someone what's going on in their life outside of skating—were all ways I found that made me feel included, so I tried to do the same for teammates younger than me."

Her emphasis on small gestures and genuine connections illustrates the impact of empathy and inclusion in a high-pressure environment.

### 5. Embrace Challenges Each Year

Each season brings new hurdles, and Maia believes that facing these challenges head-on is crucial for growth:

> "It’s not supposed to be easy. If it is, it means you’re not in the right place. Each year of your career brings a different major challenge. You struggle, you master them, and then you move on to something bigger. Growing up, I struggled with twizzles. In my first year on the Haydenettes, I struggled completing a step sequence on one foot, let alone on correct edges. Next, I faced the challenge of developing enough upper body strength to lift my teammates. As I progressed, I worked on maintaining my posture throughout run-throughs, even when I grew tired. Eventually, I focused on learning how to perform authentically to the music, finding an emotional connection and sharing it through my body movements and facial expressions. Each year I tackled a new aspect of my skating, and I knew I was ready to retire when I wasn’t looking for the next challenge, and I was satisfied with feeling 'easy.'"

Her journey through various challenges highlights the importance of persistence and adaptability in achieving long-term success.

### 6. Practice Positive Self-Talk

In the face of rigorous training and intense competition, maintaining a positive mindset is essential. Maia advocates for being one's own biggest supporter:

> "Positive self-talk is incredibly important. It doesn’t matter if you get 1000 compliments during a practice or 1000 corrections. In any situation, you must be your biggest fan in your head. You feel the most improvements. You know when something feels better than it did the practice before. Point those things out to yourself."

Her focus on internal dialogue reflects a powerful tool for resilience and self-motivation, key elements for any athlete striving for excellence.

## The Joy of Skating
Beyond the technical and mental challenges, Maia's love for skating shines through as she offers heartfelt advice to younger skaters aiming for high levels of success:

> "Never lose the joy of skating. Figure skating is a beautiful sport where we get to express ourselves to music, to distract ourselves from the realities of the outside world by working together to create a piece of art. It’s a sport that challenges our minds and bodies at once, teaching you to be a resilient problem solver and an excellent team player. But we often get stuck in the little things, scared of a certain step sequence, unable to get through an intersection. We might find ourselves comparing ourselves to a teammate or being too critical of what we look like in a video. While we need tough love moments, sometimes what you need most is the JOY. To act like a little kid dancing around and improv like crazy to a random song on the ice. To forget about calls and placements and enjoy the feeling of pushing through a physically-taxing run-through. I think I skated for as long as I did on highly competitive teams because I never let myself get bogged down in the unhappy parts of it all. I found joy skating at (almost) every single practice, which made it easy to show up and try my hardest again and again. Because that’s all you can do. Never try to be perfect, never try to skate exactly like anyone else; find joy and let that joy seep into everything you do on the ice."

Maia's reflections remind us of the intrinsic beauty of synchronized skating and the importance of retaining passion and enthusiasm throughout one's journey.

## Preparing for High-Level Synchronized Skating

To those aspiring to excel in high-level synchronized skating, Maia highlights two essential areas of preparation:

#### Develop Multitasking Skills

> "Learn to think about many different things at once. It's a valuable skill to be able to focus on the emotion you are displaying while simultaneously mentally and physically preparing to execute a no-point intersection."

This skill, honed through practice, is vital for the dynamic demands of synchronized skating.

#### Incorporate Dance into Training

> "DANCE CLASSES and DANCING! While dance classes are not something I did post third grade hip hop, I found that even dancing around in a very unserious manner did as much as official classes for me! I think it is incredibly important and valuable to be able to understand all the different ways your body can move. Whether it’s a fluid arm motion or a mid-program dance break, your coach could throw anything at you, and you want to feel as confident as possible while learning it as fast as possible. Both skills come with time and practice. It also helps with counting beats and finding accents in music. Hitting these accents will make your movements so much more powerful!"

Maia's advice underscores the importance of versatility and rhythm in synchronized skating, advocating for a holistic approach to training.
